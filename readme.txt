Along with this readme should be two files, one containing the 
code for creating dense neural networks (dense_networks.py) and 
the other containing code for creating convolutional neural 
networks (conv_networks.py). In the models folder, you can also
find all the various models I built, which can be loaded into
my programs to use the model on given data. These models are 
also the models referenced in the discussion document, which
has been included to provide analysis of the results in much 
greater detail.

Within each file, the sections are divided by subject headings. 
-Under setup, you will need to insert the file path of where your
training and testing data files are. See Data folder to use the
data that I used:
  optdigits.names (info on how data is set up)
  optdigits.tes   (testing data)
  optdigits.tra   (training data)
-Can change parameters/hyperparameters in the parameters/
hyperparameters sections (surprise)
-Under the Save and Test Model section, will need to insert the
file path of where you want each model saved, as well as what
name you would like your model to be called
